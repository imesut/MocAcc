# Moca

Moca is a mockup tool for designing accessibility experience for disabled people.

You can import your screen images and mark UI elements visible at the screen.

Then you can test your UI with visually impaired people.

# Purpose

Moca, is my weekend project, that I need to use as a product manager while working with a visually impaired community.

Designing applications or any design properly accessible requires feedback from visually impaired while working and deciding on features. Moca is a tool for interviewing design ideas with visually impaired. User interview preparation process is shown in the image below.
